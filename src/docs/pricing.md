J2cc has 3 tiers available.

## J2cc Community
For individual use, and for experimenting with the transpiler. Usable via the Discord Server.

This tier is free, and will continue to stay free forever. No credit card details are required to use this tier.

However, only basic transpiling is supported. No obfuscation features can be accessed via the Discord Server.

## J2cc Personal
For small teams or individual developers.

This tier offers transpiling, as well as basic obfuscation. If you want to protect IP of your small business or
solo developer application, this tier is perfect for you.

## J2cc Enterprise
For big corporations or enterprises.

This tier offers everything j2cc has to offer, and direct 1-1 support. This tier is best used for large applications,
which require a lot of heavy-duty protection against reverse engineering.
