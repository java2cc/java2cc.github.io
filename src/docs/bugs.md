description: How to report Bugs in j2cc
---

If you found a bug and would like to report it to the j2cc developers, please make sure you follow these steps:

### Make sure the bug is actually a bug
Sometimes, a "bug" simply was an issue with the way j2cc was configured. Make sure you check the j2cc configuration for any errors or issues.

### Create a minimal demonstration of the bug
If possible, create a small setup for us to test the bug on. Something that clearly demonstrates what the bug is about, without much clutter around it.

We can't reliably debug a j2cc issue with your entire application.

### Report the bug
You can either reach out to us via E-Mail, or over the Discord server. Both ways, someone will get in touch with you.

If you have purchased the `Enterprise` tier, you can also contact Support to file the Bug Report.

Please make sure to describe the bug in as much detail as possible. Include reproduction steps, like:
```
1. Configure property `a.b.c` to be 'abc'
2. Compile this java source file
3. Obfuscate the resulting class file with config from step 1 
```
If applicable, please also provide system details, for example which target you configured zig to use, and which OS (and arch!) you ran j2cc on.
