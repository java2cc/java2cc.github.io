J2cc is developed by one guy.

No, really. The entire project was conceptualized, prototyped, implemented and is being offered by me, Constantin.

I've worked on this project for a good while now. It started off as an early prototype in early October 2023. 
Since then, it's evolved into a massive side project I maintain next to my full time job.

I do use several libraries to make the job easier, things like objectweb's ASM to parse class files.
The main logic, all the transpiling, codegen, obfuscation and more is all written by me.

At times, nice people from the [Recaf Discord](https://discord.gg/VHfVtUwT6e) have also helped out with tricky topics regarding bytecode.
Recaf itself was also frequently used to check the generated bytecode for errors.
