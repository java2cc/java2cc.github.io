## Version 1.0.2
- Decreased size of the `<clinit>` method generated by the Method Handle reference obfuscation.
- Fixed another Flow transformer bug, which generated unverifiable bytecode when encountering an `arraylength` instruction.
- Switch to logback and slf4j for logging.
- Added method bytecode size checks to the String Literal obfuscation, to ensure big methods aren't blown up past the 65KiB method size limit.

## Version 1.0.1
- Fixed a small bug within the compiler, which compiled `lcmp`, `dcmpl`, `dcmpg` and some other instructions slightly wrong.
- Fixed a bug in the Flow transformer with flatten mode enabled, that generated unverifiable bytecode.

## Release 1.0.0
Initial release. J2cc is now available for limited purchase.
